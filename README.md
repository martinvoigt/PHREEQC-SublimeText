# PHREEQC-SublimeText
A package for the Sublime Text editor which allows running PHREEQC scripts in the editor using the build command (CTRL+B). It also provides basic syntax highlighting for PHREEQC scripts and output, and parses output files so that you can use the CTRL+R command to navigate through output files.

You'll have to extract the archive into your Sublime Text packages folder, which you can find through the Preferences - Browse packages... menu command in the editor. If your PHREEQC installation is not located in c:\phreeqc\phreeqc.exe, you have to adjust the location in the phreeqc.py script.
